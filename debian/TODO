This is an incomplete list of a number of issues that need to be fixed.


TODOs before upload to experimental

- fix new location of tdb on upgrade
  - make a list of all affected tdb's
  - move them on upgrade

- fix dependencies between packages
  - should the library packages be as the are now (eg should libsmbd0 exist as
	a separate package?)

- reexamine copyright file

- merge changes from 3.6 branch

- update changelog file to better reflect everything that changed between this
  version and the last 3.6 version

- ensure configure step doesn't fail on starting winbind/smbd/nmbd on an AD DC install

TODOs before upload to unstable

- make a list of basic tests that should be done to ensure that the package is
  acceptable for unstable (and run these tests)

- investigate impact of changes to libraries to reverse dependencies and plan
  transitions (if there are any)

- what is the status of the docs?

  - documentation2.patch is upstream
  - The former documentation.patch needs to be rewritten against the xml input

- Decide if we care about findsmb, and if so patch upstream to restore it

Other TODOs


- Add script to verify that headers are usable through current dependencies
  (to prevent bugs like #525888)
